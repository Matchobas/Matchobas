### Hi there âš¡

My name is Matheus Alexandria, I have 24 years old and I'm in the path to become a web developer. I'm currently working with data science and automation in
Mundo Pet, but my goal is start working on web developing, focusing in the server side of applications.

I enjoy programming and creating projects, lately I've studied and worked with:
1. NodeJS (Express, TypeORM, Multer, Tsyringe)
2. TypeScript
3. Python (Selenium, Requests, Pandas, NumPy)
4. Docker/Docker-compose
